sorting algorithm for customers in a store
time is calculated starting when customer enters the store, generated by random, using input for customers/hour
customer pushed into checkout based on item count
processing time is 5 seconds per item
each checkout has its own queue structure for customers to be added to, removing them from the main customer queue
this is supposed to simulate speed of various versions of the checkout


still having trouble implementing the timer
